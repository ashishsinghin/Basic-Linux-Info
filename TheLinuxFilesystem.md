![The Linux File System](https://github.com/siashish/Basic-Linux-Info/assets/45603733/f33f3615-a494-4db9-a932-79145ceb0026)


The root (/) of the filesystem is at the top of the tree, and the following are the most
important subdirectories to know:

**/root** The home directory of the all­powerful root user

**/etc** Generally contains the Linux configuration files—files that control when and how
programs start up

**/home** The user’s home directory

**/mnt** Where other filesystems are attached or mounted to the filesystem

**/media** Where CDs and USB devices are usually attached or mounted to the filesystem

**/bin** Where application binaries (the equivalent of executables in Microsoft Windows)
reside

**/lib** Where you’ll find libraries (shared programs that are similar to Windows DLLs)
